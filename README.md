## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Adobe XD

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on learning some properties of CSS Flexbox. I will continue making new challenges from Frontend Mentor to improve and learn more about CSS itself, not only Flexbox. 

### Continued development

From that project, I could see my evolution in CSS, so I feel more motivated to continue to develop new solutions for Frontend Mentor. In the future, I will build my projects using Adobe XD and Figma for UI.
